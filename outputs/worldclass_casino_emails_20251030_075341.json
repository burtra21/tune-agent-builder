Gaming equipment creates one 15-minute power spike, and you pay that peak rate for the entire month.\n\nIt's essentially a hidden margin leak that flows straight off your EBITDA.\n\nCasinos pay 3-5x higher demand rates than typical commercial buildings because gaming equipment creates electrical noise (harmonic distortion) that inflates these charges.\n\nMost energy projects focus on kWh reduction but can't touch demand charges - which is where the real margin improvement lives.",

No power interruptions. No integration with gaming systems, surveillance, or security infrastructure.\n\nThe Vegas casino kept every slot machine, table game, and critical system running during the entire installation process. Their operations team didn't need to coordinate shutdowns, backup systems, or player notifications.\n\nIt's designed specifically for facilities that can never go dark - which is exactly why it works so well for casino operations.\n\nInterested in seeing the zero-downtime installation process?"

Your gaming operations won't see any changes in power delivery. Your surveillance systems won't notice any difference.\n\nIt just quietly reduces your demand charges month after month while your team focuses on what matters - keeping gaming operations running flawlessly.\n\nThat's operational simplicity that actually delivers $715,833/month in cost reduction.\n\nWant to review the technical specifications?"

          "body": "Here's how it turns your largest operational expense into predictable savings...\n\nThe technology addresses harmonic distortion at the electrical panel level, which reduces apparent power (kVA). Lower kVA means lower demand charges from your utility - that's where the 8.59% reduction comes from.\n\nWith 50,000+ installations worldwide, we've never seen results below 5% reduction. That's why we guarantee it - full refund if savings don't meet the 5% minimum.\n\nFor WinStar's ~50,000 kW peak demand, even our guaranteed minimum of 5% means $5,000,000/year in recurring savings. The Vegas casino's 8.59% suggests you could see significantly more.\n\nNo operational changes required. No maintenance costs. Just predictable monthly reductions in your largest expense line item.\n\nReady to review the ROI model based on your specific demand profile?"
