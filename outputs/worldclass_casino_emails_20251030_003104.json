At $15/kW, that's $1,350 per month for every 90kW spike.\n\nWith Foxwoods' estimated 90,000 kW peak demand, you're likely paying around $16.2M annually just in demand charges.

        "body": "Quick question - when you review Mandalay Bay's utility bills, do you see demand charges broken out separately from energy charges?\n\nMost casino operators focus on kWh (energy consumption) but miss the bigger line item: kW demand charges. These can be $8-20 per kilowatt, every month, based on your highest 15-minute spike.\n\nHere's what's brutal about casinos: One busy night when everything's running - full gaming floor, packed restaurants, events - sets your demand rate for the entire month. Even if the next 29 days are slower.\n\nWith Mandalay Bay's estimated 42,000 kW peak demand, you're likely paying around $630,000 monthly just in demand charges. That's $7.5M annually before you even flip a switch.\n\nThe real kicker? Most of that demand reading is artificially inflated by something completely fixable.",

        "body": "Here's something your utility company won't tell you: gaming equipment creates massive harmonic distortion in your electrical system.\n\nSlot machines, VFDs on your HVAC, electronic gaming tables - they're all non-linear loads that distort the clean 60Hz power coming into your building. Most casinos run 15-25% current harmonic distortion. Compare that to office buildings at 5-8%.\n\nThis distortion increases your apparent power draw, which inflates the kW demand readings your utility meter captures. You're essentially paying demand charges on 'phantom' power that isn't doing any useful work.\n\nIt's like your electrical meter is wearing thick glasses - it can't see clearly, so it overcharges you. This is exactly why standard energy solutions (BMS optimization, LED retrofits) barely move the needle on casino utility bills. They're solving the wrong problem.\n\nYou can't control when guests show up, but you can control how much power you draw serving them.",

This was third-party verified through independent metering over 12 months. Payback was 14 months with 25-40% IRR.\n\nNow, here's what's mathematically possible for Mandalay Bay if you achieved similar results:\n\n\u2022 Current estimated demand: 42,000 kW\n\u2022 8.59% reduction = 3,608 kW savings\n\u2022 At $15/kW/month: $649,404 annual demand charge savings\n\u2022 Total projected savings: $7.2M annually (including energy)\n\u2022 5-year value: $36M\n\nI'm not guaranteeing these exact results - every facility is different.

They try to optimize equipment efficiency while ignoring the power quality feeding that equipment.\n\nTune filters work at the electrical panel level - solid-state harmonic filtration that cleans up the power before it reaches your gaming floor. No moving parts, no maintenance, 20+ year lifespan.\n\nHere's what matters for operations: Zero downtime installation. We tap into your panels during scheduled maintenance windows. Your gaming floor never goes dark, revenue never stops.\n\nThe technology is stupidly simple - it just removes the harmonic distortion your gaming equipment creates. Cleaner power means lower apparent power draw, which means lower kW demand readings on your utility meter.\n\nThis is why BMS optimization and HVAC efficiency projects don't move the needle much in casinos. They're downstream solutions to an upstream power quality problem.\n\nYour engineering team will want to see the technical specs - the installation approach is as important as the technology itself.",
