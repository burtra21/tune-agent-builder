No security system changes.\n\nThe Las Vegas casino kept every slot machine, table game, and operational system running during the entire installation process.\n\nResult? 8.59% demand reduction with zero operational disruption.\n\nWant to see the zero-downtime installation process that protects your 99.9%+ uptime requirements?"

Once installed, they work 24/7 reducing your demand charges without any ongoing operational burden.\n\nThey're completely transparent to gaming systems, surveillance equipment, and security infrastructure. Your operations team won't need training, your gaming systems won't need updates, and your maintenance schedule stays unchanged.\n\nThe Vegas casino hasn't touched their filters since installation 12+ months ago. They just collect $715,833 in monthly savings while focusing on what matters - running their casino.\n\nReady to review the technical specifications that make this hands-off operation possible?"

Tune filters address this at the electrical panel level, reducing apparent power (kVA) and lowering your demand charges.\n\nWith 50,000+ installations worldwide, we've never seen results below 5% reduction. That's why we guarantee minimum 5% savings with full refund if not achieved.\n\nFor WinStar World Casino, even our 5% minimum guarantee would mean $5,000,000/year in recurring savings.\n\nThe Vegas property achieved 8.59% - turning energy expense into operational profit.\n\nWant to review the ROI model showing your specific savings potential?"
